I was playing around with 3D graphics in p5js (you can find the results here: https://codepen.io/wesserboy/pen/dvLmQw) and the possibilities of WEB_GL intrigued me. 
I decided to try and learn how to use the real deal.
Since the main game I play these days is Minecraft, I decided to try and replicate (the basics of) this game.
This will be the project I use to explore WEB_GL.

Basically this is just my learning process, so don't expect anything to come from this.
Also, this will not be clean and nice code (for obvious reasons :P).
